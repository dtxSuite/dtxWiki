    The ``usage`` filter runs AFTER the repository's viewer masking, on the
    projection's recomputed ``usage_state``. That ordering is the point: a
    ``used`` request must never surface an asset whose only reference lives in
    somebody else's private editing draft, and ``ContextMediaAssetProjection.
    from_snapshot`` is what turns the masked counts into the state we filter on.

    260912 review: that same ordering used to break pagination. ``has_more``
    and ``next_cursor`` were computed by the ROUTE from ``len(projections)``
    -- AFTER this filter ran -- so a request like ``usage=unused&limit=50``
    that fetched 51 rows and kept only 8 unused ones reported
    ``has_more = 8 > 50 = False`` and stopped the listing there, even with
    hundreds of unused assets still unseen. No error, no truncation marker.
    ``repository.list_workspace_usage`` now fixes ``has_more``/``next_after``
    from what SQL actually returned, before this method's filter ever touches
    the rows (``WorkspaceUsagePage``'s docstring has the full argument) --
    this method's only job is to pass that pair through unfiltered.
