"""Inbox contracts: the three extension points and the values they exchange.

The service depends only on these abstractions:

* ``InboxScope`` -- where an inbox lives (a workspace, the account). It names
  the table, the owner key, the write lock and the link rule.
* ``InboxSource`` -- where a kind's items come from. ``WritableSource``
  items are written by producers and list as messages; ``StatusSource``
  items are derived on read and list as current state.
* ``InboxKind`` -- one message type: its scope, its source, how it is shown
  to the current viewer, and its own policies.

``InboxListener`` lets a delivery channel react to written items. Adding a
kind, a source, a scope or a channel implements one of these and registers
it; no service code changes.
