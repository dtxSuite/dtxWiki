"""Where a kind's items come from: written by producers, or derived on read.

A kind that should appear in the message stream materializes its items with a
``StoredSource``. A kind whose items are current state (a pending queue, a key
about to expire) derives them on read with a ``ComputedSource`` and shows in
the status group. A new source type implements ``WritableSource`` or
``StatusSource``; the registry routes kinds by that capability.
