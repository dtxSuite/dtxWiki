"""E2E-03 follow-up (S1 residual, S13, S14): what CI is allowed to publish.

``tests/static/test_e2e_artifact_redaction_contract.py`` guards what the e2e
*harness* writes. This module guards the step after that one: what the two e2e
jobs hand to ``actions/upload-artifact``.

The gap it closes. The Playwright HTML reporter appends the entire report as a
base64-encoded zip inside ``<template id="playwrightReportBase64">`` in
``index.html`` (node_modules/playwright/lib/reporters/html.js:335). Every step
title goes in there on **every** run, passing runs included and regardless of
the trace or screenshot mode -- so
``resetPage.goto("/reset-password?token=<one-time token>")`` is published by a
green run, ``if: always()``, for 14 days. The token is nowhere in the file as
plaintext, so grepping the report finds nothing and a stdin->stdout pipe over
it changes nothing.

Three things therefore have to hold together, and each is pinned below:

1. Both e2e jobs run ``scripts/redact_evidence.sh --dir`` over the directory
   they are about to upload, before the upload step.
2. That mode actually reaches the base64 payload -- decode, redact, rebuild --
   and leaves the reporter's own application bytes alone.
3. The break-glass hard-fail (production secret env name, PEM private key)
   survives in both modes.

Plus S13: the frontend job's node is pinned at or above 22.18, because that
job is the only place the e2e helper self-runners execute and they need
unflagged TypeScript type stripping.
