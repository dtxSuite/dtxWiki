"""Pin the artifact gate in front of PyPI.

release.yml fires on any ``v*`` tag while ci.yml runs only on pull requests and
pushes to main, so a tag can reach `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` on a commit no
other workflow ever built. These tests keep the gate from being narrowed back
to the three `test -f` calls it used to be.
