"""Guard control-plane session access at known calls and dependency annotations.

Pins "no domain-table access via the shared control plane" as an enforced
invariant. It ships as TWO allowlists, because "acquire the control-plane
session" has two syntactically distinct shapes in this codebase, found by
two different AST checks:

1. ``CONTROL_SESSION_FACTORY_ALLOWLIST`` -- a call expression that directly
   returns the control factory: ``<expr>.control_session_factory()``, or
   ``get_session_factory_from_app(...)`` (backend/app/state.py), which is
   just that same call one layer down. Checked by
   ``control_session_factory_call_sites``.
2. ``SESSION_FACTORY_DEP_ALLOWLIST`` -- a function parameter type-annotated
   ``SessionFactoryDep`` (backend/api/deps.py's named FastAPI alias for
   ``Depends(get_session_factory)``): the SAME control session, acquired by
   dependency injection instead of a call expression, so (1) never sees it.
   This was a real, proven gap -- the admin retry endpoint (fix commit
   ae92155a) reached the control plane through exactly this route and
   passed the gate as it stood before this dual-allowlist split. Checked by
   ``session_factory_dep_call_sites``.

Both use the same allowlist-by-file idiom
``backend/scripts/export_openapi.py`` uses for
``OPENAPI_SESSION_COOKIE_ROUTES``/``OPENAPI_PUBLIC_ROUTES``. Without this gate
Phase 2's media-seam completion (D-1) can regress silently — a future call
site can reach back onto the control plane and nothing would notice once an
overlay actually shards the database.

This is a file-level gate, not a call-site or data-flow gate (tracing which
ORM model a session ends up reading is not tractable as a static check).
A file can legitimately mix an allowed identity-plane read
with a not-yet-fixed domain read; where that happens the allowlist reason
below says so explicitly and the finding is also reported out-of-band,
because the point of this gate is to make *future* violations loud, not to
launder existing ones into silence.

Where the tractability line is actually drawn, and why: both checks above
match a NAMED, unambiguous AST node (a specific attribute/function-name call,
or a specific type-annotation name) — no data-flow tracing, no resolving
what a variable was assigned from three lines up. That rules in
``get_session_factory_from_app(...)`` and ``SessionFactoryDep`` (both single,
named, greppable things) and rules out, deliberately:

- A module-level or local alias the control factory gets assigned to under
  an arbitrary name (e.g. ``_cf = db.control_session_factory`` used later as
  ``_cf()``) — the call site itself would need type inference to recognize.
- A sessionmaker/factory passed as a plain function argument from a caller
  that DID call ``.control_session_factory()`` to a callee that reads a
  table from it under some other parameter name — invisible without
  call-graph/type-flow analysis across function boundaries.
- A *different* Annotated/Depends alias that wraps
  ``Depends(get_session_factory)`` (or an equivalent) under a name other
  than ``SessionFactoryDep`` — there is no such alias in this codebase
  today (grep confirms ``SessionFactoryDep`` is defined exactly once, in
  backend/api/deps.py), but nothing here would catch one if it existed;
  doing so needs the same alias-definition resolution as the point above.

All three require resolving aliases or tracing data flow beyond these checks;
SessionFactoryDep
detection widens WHAT counts as "the control session" without moving that
line.

# The two tests above prove the SERVICE resolves identity labels on the

# they would repeat PIN-NAMES-THE-WRONG-THING: a route that stopped asking
# would leave them green. This check covers that gap at the only level this
# file can reach without data-flow analysis -- the route function's own shape.
#
# What it proves: the named route still takes the control-plane
# SessionFactoryDep, still builds a DeferredIdentityLabels, and still applies
# it. What it does not prove: that the sink is applied on the CONTROL session
# rather than the workspace one, or that the workspace session is closed first.
# Those need a split provider driving the route, which lives in
