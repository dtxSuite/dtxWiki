"""Pin how every GitHub workflow gets its toolchain and scans its history.

Toolchain and publication rules, with counterexamples for reusable checkers:

1. Every ``uv sync`` installs exactly what uv.lock records (``--locked``).
   Without the flag a sync silently re-resolves whenever pyproject.toml and
   uv.lock disagree, so CI tests -- and the release job builds -- dependency
   versions nobody locked or reviewed.
2. Every ``actions/setup-node`` pins the node in ``.nvmrc``, and every job that
   runs node sets it up first instead of inheriting whatever the runner image
   ships (`make test-static` and the release-gate tests start node too).
3. The leak scan runs the MIT-licensed gitleaks CLI from an image pinned by tag
   and digest, in ``git`` mode over the whole fetched history, redacted, and
   able to fail the job. gitleaks-action is not an option: it requires a
   GITLEAKS_LICENSE on an organization repository and exits 1 without one.
4. The CLA workflow runs on ``pull_request_target`` with write-scoped tokens,
   so every action in it is pinned to a commit rather than a movable tag, and
   it does not run on ``closed`` (only the disabled lock-after-merge feature
   needs that event). Its wiring is pinned too: this repository's token can
   only read code, comment and re-run; the signatures live on the main branch
   of the private signature repository and are written with a GitHub App token
   minted for that one repository with contents access only, never with a
   stored personal access token; the triggers and job gate the acceptance
   statement relies on; the protected cla-v1 tag as the document; and an
   allowlist without wildcards or bot names, which anyone can put in a commit's
   author field.
5. The ordinary E2E job uses the official Playwright image at the version
   recorded in package-lock.json. A package update without a matching image
   update leaves the requested browser executable revision unavailable. Its
   execution user also matches Actions' HOME owner so Firefox can launch.
