 * document link, citation, or membership even if it belongs to that layer.
 * The verb picks the activity stroke: writes, citations, reads (a body read or
 * evidence included in an answer) and structure-only looks each have one.
 * A kind absent here has no designed line and is not drawn (nor listed in the
